### 1. How do credits work?
Each tool and its settings will display the number of credits (Flames) required for use. Credits are deducted from your account when you start a generation. Plan your usage based on the credits available in your account or subscription tier.

### 2. What happens when I run out of credits?
You will need to top up your credits to continue using the generation tools. You can purchase additional credit packs or upgrade your subscription for more monthly credits.

### 3. Can I top up credits without upgrading my subscription?
Yes, you can purchase one-time credit packs at any time, regardless of your subscription status.

### 4. What's included in each pricing tier?
