### 1. Will my character look the same across different outputs?
Our advanced AI strives for strong character consistency across different images and videos. While there might be subtle variations due to the creative nature of AI, your character's core features will remain recognizable, allowing you to build a consistent persona.

### 2. Is it legal to use the characters I generate commercially?
Yes, as the characters and visuals are generated by AI based on your inputs and our models, you generally have broad rights to use your creations. However, always ensure your usage complies with our Terms of Service and respects intellectual property rights if you are basing characters on existing protected works.
