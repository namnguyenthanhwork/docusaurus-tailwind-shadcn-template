### 1. What makes a good base image for creating a character?
A clear, front-facing image of your model looking at the camera works best. Good lighting and a relatively unobstructed view of the face help our AI understand the features better. While our AI is powerful, starting with a quality image gives you the best results for character creation.

### 2. How long does it take to create a character model?
It's incredibly fast! You can have your AI character model ready and start generating content within just a few minutes.

### 3. Why did my model creation fail?
This can happen for a few reasons, such as the uploaded image file size being too large, or a temporary technical hiccup. Sometimes, very unusual angles or poor image quality might make it difficult for the AI to create a consistent character. Please ensure your image meets our guidelines, try a different photo if issues persist, or contact support to raise an issue.

### 4. Can I edit a model after it's been created?
Yes, you can continue to refine and evolve your character by generating new images and guiding the AI with your prompts. Selecting the best outputs helps reinforce your character's look.

### 5. Why is my model not looking like the uploaded photo?
Ensure the photo is clear, well-lit, and front-facing. If the resemblance isn't strong, try a different base photo with more distinct facial features. The AI learns from the images you provide, so high-quality inputs are key.
