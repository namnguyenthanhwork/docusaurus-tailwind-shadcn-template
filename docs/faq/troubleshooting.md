### 1. Why is my generation taking too long?
Generation times can vary based on server load, the complexity of your request, and the specific AI model being used. High demand or very complex requests can sometimes lead to longer processing times. If it seems unusually long, please check our status page (if available) or contact support.

### 2. Why is my image or video blurry?
Blurriness can sometimes occur with complex prompts or specific AI interpretations. Try simplifying your prompt or being more specific about the desired sharpness. Ensuring your base images (if used for character creation or image-to-video) are clear and high-quality can also help. Our upscaler tool, when available, can also improve clarity on generated images.

### 3. Why do I see artifacts or weird distortions?
AI generation is a creative process and occasionally produces unexpected results or artifacts (like unusual hands or background elements). Refining your prompt, especially using negative prompts (e.g., 'no extra limbs', 'no blurry background'), can significantly reduce these. If distortions persist with a specific character or style, our support team can offer guidance.

### 4. How do I fix a model that looks too generic or distorted?
If your initial character creation isn't quite right, the best approach is to try with a different base image that has clearer facial features and good lighting. You can also refine the character by generating new images with detailed prompts and selecting those outputs that best represent your vision to reinforce its look over time.
