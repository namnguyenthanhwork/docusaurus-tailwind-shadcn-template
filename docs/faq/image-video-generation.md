### 1. How do I generate images using my model?
Once your character is ready, select it from your library. Then, simply type your desired scene, style, or action in the prompt box, and let KreatorFlow bring your vision to life! It's that simple.

### 2. Can I change my model's pose, clothing, or background?
Absolutely! Describe the pose, outfit, and scene in your prompt. The more descriptive you are, the closer the AI can get to your vision. For instance, try 'Character Name wearing a red dress, sitting on a park bench, sunny day'.

### 3. How do I create videos with my model?
Creating videos is a seamless next step. After generating an image you love with your character, you can easily animate it using our 'Convert to Video' option. You can also start fresh by uploading an image to the 'Image to Video' section and add motion and effects.

### 4. What does 'image-to-video' mean?
You can take any image—whether generated on KreatorFlow or uploaded from your device—and use our Image-to-Video tool to animate it, bringing static pictures to life with dynamic motion and effects.

### 5. What are the best practices for face swapping?
For the best face swapping results, use clear, well-lit photos or videos where the face is relatively front-facing and not heavily obscured. High-quality source material will yield more realistic and seamless swaps.
