# How to Prompt Your Character

After creating your character, the next step is to generate your first image using a **prompt**. A prompt is a short description of the scene, action, or setting you want your character to appear in.

### âœ… Step 1: Go to Character Studio

1. From your **Dashboard**, click on the character you just created.
2. You'll now see your character's face, pose options, and prompt input fields.

### âœ… Step 2: Select Your Engine and Settings

- **Engine Type**: Choose either:
    - **Kreatorflow Model** *(default)* â€” best for photorealistic influencer-style images
    - **Kreatorflow Art** â€” for stylized, more artistic generations
- **Mode**: Start with **Basic** for quicker results. Switch to **Advanced** later for more control.
- **Pose**: You can add or manage poses here â€” or toggle "Ignore pose and use face-only generation" if you want a spontaneous composition.

### âœ… Step 3: Write Your Prompt

Type your prompt in the **"Your Prompt"** field.

This tells the AI what your character should be doing, where they are, and what they're wearing.

ðŸ“Œ **Best Practice:** Always begin with *"My character..."* to ensure your model's trained face is used consistently.

ðŸ“Œ **Example Prompt:**

> "My character sitting on a swing above the sea wearing soft white linens, sunny weather, cinematic backlight."

### âœ… Step 4: Add a Negative Prompt *(Optional)*

In the **"Your Negative Prompt"** field, you can describe things you want to avoid â€” like "blurry," "extra limbs," or "weird hands." This is optional but useful when refining outputs.

---

### âœ… Step 5: Click "Generate Images"

Once your prompt is written, click the **"Generate Images"** button at the bottom.

Each generation costs **3 Flames**, which are automatically deducted from your balance.

ðŸ”¥ **Different Settings Will Change the Amounts of flames in each page.** ðŸ”¥


Your image will be ready in a few seconds.

### âœ… Step 6: Convert to Video

Once your image is generated, click **"Convert to Video"** below the image to bring your scene to life with cinematic animation and camera movement.

ðŸŽ¥ This is the next step in your creative flow and the best way to turn static content into dynamic visual assets.
