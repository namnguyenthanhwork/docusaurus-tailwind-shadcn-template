# How to Start: Creating Your First Character on Kreatorflow

Welcome to KreatorFlow! Follow the steps below to create your first AI character. This process is simple, fast, and requires just one image.

## ✅ Step 1: Choose or Generate Your Base Image

You can start in one of two ways:

### Option A: Upload Your Own Image

Upload a high-quality, front-facing image that you own the rights to. The face should be clear, well-lit, and unobstructed for best results.

📌 **Recommended Specs:**

- Front-facing, neutral or soft expression
- No sunglasses or heavy filters
- At least 512x512 resolution
- Only one visible face in the image

📸 **Image Examples (Good vs. Bad Upload):**

Good Example:
<img src="/img/guides/good-base-image-example.png" alt="Good Base Image Example" style={{maxWidth: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '10px auto'}} />

Bad Example:
<img src="/img/guides/bad-base-image-example.jpg" alt="Bad Base Image Example" style={{maxWidth: '400px', display: 'block', margin: '10px auto'}} />


### Option B: Generate a Base Image on Kreatorflow

If you don't have an image, go to the [**Create Page**](https://www.kreatorflow.ai/create) and generate a base character using our presets or custom sliders.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <video controls autoplay muted loop playsinline style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '8px', margin: 'auto'}}>
    <source src="https://d1kk0g0n34kia1.cloudfront.net/DocsUI.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag. Please visit <a href="https://d1kk0g0n34kia1.cloudfront.net/DocsUI.mp4">this link</a> to view the video.
  </video>
</div>

Once you're happy with the generated image, save or download it so you can use it to create your character.

## ✅ Step 2: Upload the Image to Create Your Character

1.  Go to your [**Character** page](https://www.kreatorflow.ai/character) (Ensure you are logged in).
2.  Click **"New Character"**.
3.  Upload your selected or generated image.
4.  Give your character a name.
5.  Select the settings that match how you want your character to look (our smart defaults work great too!).
6.  Click **"Create Character"**.
