Introducing the **Faceswap Studio** on KreatorFlow.AI â€“ your new playground for creative transformations! We're thrilled to roll out this highly anticipated feature, allowing you to seamlessly swap faces in both images and videos.

### ðŸŽ­ Faceswap Has Arrived!

*   **Image Face Swapping**:
    *   **Single Face Swap**: Easily swap the largest detected face from a source image onto a target image.
    *   **Multi-Face Swap**: Take control with precision! Specify which faces to copy from your source image and which faces to replace on your target image using numerical indexing. This is perfect for group photos or complex scenes.
*   **Video Face Swapping (Beta)**:
    *   Bring a new level of dynamism by swapping faces in video clips.
    *   Supports single and multi-face swapping in videos, similar to our image capabilities.
    *   Upload your source face image and target video (MP4 format supported).
*   **Flexible Inputs**:
    *   Upload your own images/videos or paste direct URLs for both source and target media.
    *   Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for easy file handling.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: We've designed the Faceswap Studio to be intuitive, allowing you to achieve stunning results with minimal effort.

This is just the beginning for Faceswap on KreatorFlow.AI. We're excited to see the incredible and imaginative content you'll create. Head over to the new Faceswap tab and start experimenting!
