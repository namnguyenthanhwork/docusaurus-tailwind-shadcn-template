We're dedicated to helping you create compelling and recognizable characters. This update to our **Character Page** focuses on enhancing consistency, offering more customization, and streamlining your workflow.

### ðŸ‘¤ Character Generation Upgrades:

*   **Improved Character Consistency**: Our AI models have been refined to provide even better facial and feature consistency across multiple image generations. Your characters will now maintain their unique look more reliably in diverse scenes and styles.
*   **Advanced Augmentation Prompts**:
    *   **Positive Augmentation**: When you select a character, their core description (gender, age, ethnicity, hair, body type) is now automatically used to reinforce their appearance. You can further refine this by editing the positive augmentation prompt.
    *   **Negative Augmentation**: We've enhanced the default negative styling prompts to reduce common artifacts and improve overall image quality. You can also customize this to exclude specific elements.
    *   **Toggle Augmentations**: Easily enable or disable positive and negative augmentations to see their impact.
*   **Enhanced Pose Management**:
    *   **Add Custom Poses**: You can now upload your own images to create and save custom poses for your characters, giving you precise control over their stance and presentation.
    *   **Intuitive Pose Selection**: The interface for selecting and managing poses has been improved for a more user-friendly experience.
    *   **Disable Pose Option**: Easily toggle whether to use a selected pose or allow the AI to generate a more spontaneous composition based purely on the face and prompt.
*   **Refined Generation Settings**:
    *   **Face & Pose Strength**: More granular control over how strongly the AI adheres to the character's face and the selected pose.
    *   **Engine Types & Quality**: Choose between different engine types and quality settings (like "Ultra Quality") to balance speed, style, and detail.
*   **Streamlined Character Dashboard**: The character management interface (`app/character/page.tsx`) has been updated for better organization and quicker access to your character library and their generated content.
*   **Integrated Character Feed & Gallery**: View all images and videos generated with a specific character directly from their dedicated feed, with options to filter by content type.

We're excited for you to experience these enhancements and create even more amazing and consistent characters!
